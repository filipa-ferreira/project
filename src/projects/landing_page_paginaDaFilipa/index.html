        <article class="text">Originally from Tr√°s-os-Montes, I moved to Porto when I started university. I began my professional career in consulting and stayed there until I started working in a seafish processing industry, where I collaborated in the areas of quality and production.<br>
        As a production manager, I felt the need to improve processes through technology, so that we could measure productivity and performance in real time. In partnership with a software development company, we created an application that allowed for significant improvement in processes. Enchanted with the production process and the final result of this application, I sought to learn more to gain knowledge in web development and help industries and anyone in need!<br>
        Here you can get to know me better and see my learning projects.</article> -->
